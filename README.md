# deleteHelper
Recently I was deleting some useless repositories and found it too annoying to enter a confirmation message every time.(Copy and paste operation is also very annoying!) So I wrote this script. It's like when you want to forget something that makes you sad, but someone asks you to memorize the sad thing first before letting you forget it.
## Usage
Copy this script to a user-defined script in [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/?locale=en), save it and enable it.
## Examples
### github
![github](github.gif)  

To prevent accidental deletion. I added a space at the end of the string. Gives a chance to repent.
### dockerhub
![dockerhub](dockerhub.gif)
